## About Me

I'm an Argentinian that moved to England looking for new things to learn, this is how I found my passion for code. I'm an ambitious and passionate Full Stack Junior Developer, looking to direct my love for code towards a career in web development. 

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) after 16 intensive weeks of learning how to write clean, maintainable and tested code. At Makers, we also focused on TDD, Agile working practices and working as a team. There was also a lot of emphasis on emotional intelligence and empathy.

## Education
**Universidad de Tucuman** (March 2020 - November 2021)

_Facultad de Ciencias Economicas_

- After graduating from secondary school in 2019, I did 2 years of university where I studied Economics. 
Including: Maths, Business administration and Economy principles 1 and 2.

## Work Experience

**House of Feasts** (March 2022 - May 2022)  
_Waitress_

- Working in hospitality helped me improve my ability to learn new things quickly, how to solve problems efficiently being under pressure. Also how to work and communicate as a team.

## Tech Experience

#### Makers Academy (August 2022 - November 2022)
A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, focusing on:

- Ruby, JavaScript - including Node and Express
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Object-oriented design
- Test driven development - RSpec, Jest and Cypress
- Agile methodologies, Pair-programming and following XP values
- Git versioning workflow
- Databases - PostgreSQL, MongoDB(Mongoose)
- HTTP and REST APIs
- Deployment - Heroku

What I'm most proud of my journey in Makers is that for the first team project I had 5 weeks to learn Ruby to build an AirBnb clone. For the second team project I had 2 weeks to learn new tools(e.g JavaScript) to build a Facebook clone and for the last project I didn't have time to learn new things. I only had 2 weeks to build a functional app while learning new technologies(e.g React Native) and using the ones that I already had experience with and adapting them to our needs.

Another thing I really enjoyed is having the opportunity to be a mentor to someone that was starting Makers. Not only talking about code and solving bugs together but also, sharing my experience, things I wish I'd known earlier or any useful tip like the importance of taking breaks and giving/receiving feedback to improve not only technical skills but to become a better human.

## Skills

#### Problem solving 
I strongly believe that where there is a will, there is a way. I stay focused on the objective at hand, come up with an action plan, evaluate the pros and cons and use a quick feedback loop to get to the solution that best addresses the issues at hand. I believe that as software engineer it is esential to be comfortable with being uncomfortable and not having all the answers but having a very well established process which eventually leads you to the solution.

#### Fast and independent learner
I am a quick, logical and systematic learner, and my technical skill set has been growing exponentially since joining Makers. Here, I was able to strengthen my Ruby and JavaScript programming abilities to the point where I felt comfortable creating an AirBnb clone, a Facebook clone and a mobile app where I used React Native for the frontend and NodeJs to connect with Spotify API for the backend. I've been exposed to multiple tools from testing frameworks like Rspec and Jest to continuous integration with Cypress and deployment to production on Heroku.

#### Communication
I believe I know how to communicate my ideas in a clear and efficient way, also I'm a really good listener, I take every idea into consideration to get to the best solution. I've proven this working in teams in both, hospitality and Makers, where I had to be a leader sometimes, as a scrum master(agile methodology) or as the manager in a restaurant, but also be lead as part of the team.

#### Adaptability
Having the ability to adapt to changes quickly can be benefitial when approaching new or difficult challenges. This year I moved to England from Argentina, where I was born and raised. Leaving my whole life back looking for new opportunities was the biggest challenge I've ever faced. For me, getting used to my new reality wasn't as hard as I expected. I've improved my ability to communicate in English in a short period of time while becoming familiar with the British culture.

# Guillermina Lorenzo Martinez

I'm an Argentinian that moved to England looking for new things to learn, this is how I found my passion for code. I'm an ambitious and passionate Full Stack Junior Developer, looking to direct my love for code towards a career in web development. 

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) after 16 intensive weeks of learning how to write clean, maintainable and tested code. At Makers, we also focused on TDD, Agile working practices and working as a team. There was also a lot of emphasis on emotional intelligence and empathy.

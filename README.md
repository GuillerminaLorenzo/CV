# Guillermina Lorenzo Martinez

I'm an Argentinian that moved to England looking for new things to learn, this is how I found my passion for code. I'm an ambitious and passionate Full Stack Junior Developer, looking to direct my love for code towards a career in web development. 

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) after 16 intensive weeks of learning how to write clean, maintainable and tested code. At Makers, we also focused on TDD, Agile working practices and working as a team. There was also a lot of emphasis on emotional intelligence and empathy.

## Work Experience

**House of Feasts** (March 2022 - May 2022)  
_Waitress_

- Working in hospitality helped me improve my ability to learn new things quickly, how to solve problems efficiently being underpressure. Also how to work as a team and communicate with customers.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### Fast and independent learner
I am a quick, logical and systematic learner, and my technical skill set has been growing exponentially since joining Makers. During the first 8 weeks at Makers, I was able to strengthen my Ruby and JavaScript programming abilities to the point where I felt comfortable creating an AirBnb clone, a Facebook clone and a mobile app where I used React Native for the frontend and NodeJs to connect with Spotify API for the backend. I've been exposed to multiple tools from testing frameworks like Rspec and Jest to continuous integration with Cypress and deployment to production on Heroku.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

# Guillermina Lorenzo Martinez

I'm an Argentinian that moved to England looking for new things to learn, this is how I found my passion for code. I'm an ambitious and passionate Full Stack Junior Developer, looking to direct my love for code towards a career in web development. 

I recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) after 16 intensive weeks of learning how to write clean, maintainable and tested code. At Makers, we also focused on TDD, Agile working practices and working as a team. There was also a lot of emphasis on emotional intelligence and empathy.

## Work Experience

**House of Feasts** (March 2022 - May 2022)  
_Waitress_

- Working in hospitality helped me improve my ability to learn new things quickly, how to solve problems efficiently being underpressure. Also how to work as a team and communicate with customers.

## Skills

#### Problem solving skills
I strongly believe that where there is a will, there is a way. I stay focused on the objective at hand, come up with an action plan, evaluate the pros and cons and use a quick feedback loop to get to the solution that best addresses the issues at hand. I believe that as software engineer it is esential to be comfortable with being uncomfortable and not having all the answers but having a very well established process which eventually leads you to the solution.

#### Fast and independent learner
I am a quick, logical and systematic learner, and my technical skill set has been growing exponentially since joining Makers. Here, I was able to strengthen my Ruby and JavaScript programming abilities to the point where I felt comfortable creating an AirBnb clone, a Facebook clone and a mobile app where I used React Native for the frontend and NodeJs to connect with Spotify API for the backend. I've been exposed to multiple tools from testing frameworks like Rspec and Jest to continuous integration with Cypress and deployment to production on Heroku.
